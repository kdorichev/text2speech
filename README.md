# Text-To-Speech Dataset Preparation Tools and Architecture



This repository holds:

* a few functions useful for texts normalization for Text-To-Speech (TTS) Dataset preparation;
* a script implementing couple pipelines using those functions.

## Installation

For now simply clone this repository and use the python files in the text2speech directory.

## How to use

Run `python normalize_text.py` to see usage message.

See [tests in the documentation](https://kdorichev.github.io/text2speech/text_norm/) to get the idea how functions are expected to work.

## Development

All phases of development (coding, testing, documentation) are being done completely inside Jupyter Notebooks, thanks to the excellent tool [`nbdev`](http://nbdev.fast.ai/) by [`fast.ai`](https://www.fast.ai/) team.
